        <h2>Chinatown Project</h2>
        <p>Group of me, Karl and Eric began our research in a broad area of Manhattanâ€™s Chinatown, as we scoped further we decided on a specific part of an underpass in that Chinatown under the Manhattan Bridge.
           Our big question was how to make the bridge feel more inviting and more aesthetic, and our solution to this was to make the bridge look bigger with mirrors on two sides. After researching and testing our plans on the miniature of the bridge we made
           , we tested our final design, which is put reflective disks on card boards on the site and got significant results.</p>
