                  <h2>Part One: Ideation</h2>
                  <p>Our group began our research in a broad area of Manhattan’s Chinatown, but as we scoped further we decided on a specific part of an underpass in that Chinatown under the Manhattan Bridge. 
                     Our big question was just to make the bridge feel more inviting and more aesthetic, and our solution to this was to make the bridge look bigger with mirrors on two sides.</p>

                  <h2>Part Two: Miniature</h2>
                  <p>In this final design, we incorporated ideas that we liked best from all the prototypes and added a bit of extra design that is influenced by traditional Chinese culture. While this may
                    not be the exact final design that we implement, we have tackled many of the issues that we began the project with and are now ready to finally put our design out into the real world.
                    In this design, we repositioned the mirrors to give more space on the sidewalk as well as add two more mirrors on opposite ends of the venue. Our final product will look similar to this
                    but adapted to the actual location of our project. </p>

                  <h2>Part Three: Application</h2>
                  <p>After our final project was completed, it was time to implement it at our site and gauge feedback. We wanted to go at an optimal time that would not disrupt the vendors as they set up,
                    so we woke up early at 7 AM and gathered our materials and arrived at our site around 8:30 AM. Before the vendors started setting up, we chose an empty place to set down our CD art-boards
                    and started attaching them to the bases. After we assembled the art we began recording people’s reactions to the project, as well as interviewed some of the passerby’s and vendors.
                    Though we were confident in our work, we did not expect our project to receive a response as positive as it did in the final version. People walking by almost always looked at our art,
                    some took pictures, some talked about it with their companions, and some people (locals, vendors, and pedestrians alike) actually came up to us to ask about it. </p>

                  <h2>Part Four: Reflection</h2>
                  <p>All in all, we believe this project to be very successful. We started off with the large scope of Manhattan’s Chinatown, did extensive research, and scoped down to the underpass area that we would finally use. We then gauged this scope with our professor who gave us some recommendations on what to research and interesting things to think about. Our group took all of this into consideration and researched other underpass installations, how our project would affect stakeholders, and how to make our project intervene in that site in a beautiful and creative way. We narrowed our scope down even further with that research and built a lofi prototype around our idea and did a few iterations to see what would look best, we brought that prototype in and received great feedback in which we implemented into our final project. We tested a few iterations on the final project and stuck with our favorite and then implemented it into the site, where we observed people’s reactions and interviewed a few people to see how well-received our project was. This project was definitely a learning process for all of us and we were happy to be able to work together and create such a great experience for many people at our site. </p>
