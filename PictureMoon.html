                After a whole night writing essay for my expository writing class, me and my friend
                Karl was too tired to get some sleep. Instead sleeping in the Bobst library or going
                back to dormitary, we decided to walk to Brooklyn Bridge and wait for the sunrise.

                The dawn comes ealier than we thought. When we arrived at city hall, the sun is already
                starting to rise. We rushed to the Bridge and took numerous amazing pictures. The sky line of downtown and midtown
                the Manhattan Bridge and also the Easter river.

                When we walk till the end of the Brooklyn Bridge, Karl suddenly called me and let me see the
                Moon between the buildings. The composition was perfect. But my lens is not that telephoto so I
                used crop mode and finally get this amazing picture.
